    This is the only country that does not have a standard rectangular flag; it's also the oldest official flag in the world - with the basic design going back over 2000 years. The blue frame stands for harmony and peace, reminiscent of Buddha, who was born here. Crimson, on the other hand, is the national color. Some people compare the triangles with the Himalayan summits, but they are actually a Hindu symbol.

    The blue in the Greek flag is thought to represent the Mediterranean Sea and the white – the white houses along the shore, while others think that the five stripes on the flag stand for the national slogan ‘Freedom or Death’. All agree on one thing – the cross represents Orthodox Christianity.

    The green background and the yellow rhombus symbolize the former colonial government, the Braganza-Habsburg dynasty. The former coat of arms was replaced by a blue circle with 27 white stars, with the identical positioning of the stars above Rio on the 15th November 1889, each star representing a state. The slogan in the middle means ‘order and progress’.

    The red colour is reminiscent of the cross of St. George, the protector of the state, and white is taken from the French royal Coat of arms. The maple leaf represents the beautiful Canadian nature, at least during the summer.

    Few Australians know the unique and proud story of our flag –the only national flag to fly over an entire continent, but also the first to be chosen in an open public competition. Union Jack represents Australia’s historical links with the United Kingdom. The white 7-pointed Commonwealth Star stands for the unity of the six states and the territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Southern Cross, a constellation of five stars that can only be seen in the night skies of the Southern hemisphere, symbolizes Australia’s position in the southern hemisphere. The formal name of the Southern Cross is “Crux Australis” and the individual stars are named by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in order of brightness – Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon.
