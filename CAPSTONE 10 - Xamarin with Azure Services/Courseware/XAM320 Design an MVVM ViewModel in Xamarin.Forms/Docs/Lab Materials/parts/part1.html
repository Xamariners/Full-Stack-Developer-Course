        <h2>Exercise 1: Driving behavior through properties (XAM320)</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you'll add in selection support, and use data triggers to change the UI based on property values exposed in view models.</p>
<blockquote class="info-quote">To complete the exercise, you will need <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio for Windows or macOS</a> with the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/" target="_blank">Xamarin development tools</a> installed. You will also need either an emulator/simulator or a device to run the exercise on. Please see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/cross-platform/get-started/installation/" target="_blank">setup page</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.

<h2>Open the starter solution</h2>
<p>Open the starter solution from the <strong>Exercise 1</strong> &gt; <strong>Start</strong> folder in your copy of the cloned or downloaded <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/XAM320/">course materials</a> in either <strong>Visual Studio</strong> on Windows or <strong>Visual Studio for Mac</strong>.</p>
<p>Build and run the application to make sure it is working before making changes. It displays quotes using an XML data file as the backing storage.
There are two projects that implement the data infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>GreatQuotes</strong>
<p>This is the shared PCL which contains the XAML pages, converters and common data structures used in the application. The common data used is in the <strong>Data</strong> folder and consists of three files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GreatQuote.cs</strong> is a model class for a single quote.</li>
<li><strong>IQuoteLoader.cs</strong> is an interface which is implemented by the <strong>QuoteLoader</strong> class in the shared project which is used to load and save the quotes to an XML file.</li>
<li><strong>QuoteManager.cs</strong> is a static class with two static methods to load and save the quotes. It resolves <strong>IQuoteLoader</strong> from the Xamarin.Forms Dependency Service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>GreatQuotes.Data</strong>
<p>This is a Shared Project which contains a single source file to load the quotes from an XML file.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>QuoteLoader.cs</strong> is a static class which implements the <code>IQuoteLoader</code> interface.
It uses compiler directives to split up the platform specific code.  This class is loaded into the Xamarin.Forms Dependency Service.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Add selection support</h2>
<p>Your first step is to add some property support for selection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>MainViewModel</code> and add a new public property of type <code>QuoteViewModel</code> named <strong>SelectedQuote</strong>. Use a public getter and setter, and use a backing field.</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to implement property change notification when setting the new property - as a quick shortcut, you can use the <code>SetPropertyValue</code> method from the base view model - this will set the underlying field and raise a property change notification for you. It has the form:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>SetPropertyValue&lt;T&gt;(ref T field, T newValue);
</code></pre>

<pre class="prettyprint-collapse"><code>QuoteViewModel selectedQuote;
public QuoteViewModel SelectedQuote {
    get {
        return selectedQuote;
    }
    set {
        SetPropertyValue(ref selectedQuote, value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

</li>
<li>
<p>Next, let's use the property. Open the <strong>QuoteListPage.xaml</strong> file and locate the <code>ListView</code>. Add a new property binding for the <code>SelectedItem</code> property to the view model property. Use a two-way binding (<code>Mode</code> property). Leave the <code>ItemTapped</code> event handler in place, you still need that for the moment to handle navigation.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint-collapse"><code>&lt;ListView ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding Quotes}&quot;
    <mark>SelectedItem=&quot;{Binding SelectedQuote, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;</mark>
    ItemTapped=&quot;OnQuoteSelected&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>

</li>
<li>
Next, open the code behind file (<strong>QuoteListPage.xaml.cs</strong>) and locate the <code>OnQuoteSelected</code> method. It's currently passing the tapped item to the <code>QuoteDetailPage</code> as part of the constructor. Remove the parameter, you don't need it anymore as long as the second page has access to the view model!
</li>
<li>Finally, open the <strong>QuoteDetailPage.xaml.cs</strong> file and fix the constructor to not take the parameter. Instead, change the <code>BindingContext</code> to be the <code>SelectedQuote</code> property of the <code>MainViewModel</code>. Remember the view model is a singleton exposed by the <code>App</code> class.</li>
<li>Run the application and make sure it still works properly - it should correctly navigate and still display the quote details when it's on the second screen. However, there is a minor, but annoying bug on some platforms. When you return to the original screen, the <code>ListView</code> still shows selection and the cell you tapped on is highlighted. Let's fix that.</li>
<li>In the <code>QuoteDetailPage</code> constructor, clear the <code>SelectedQuote</code> property (set it to <code>null</code>) after you set the <code>BindingContext</code>. This will clear the <code>ListView</code> selection.</li>
<li>Run the app again to verify the change.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Use DataTriggers</h2>
<p>If you examine the <code>QuoteListPage</code> or <code>QuoteDetailPage</code> XAML, you will find it uses a value converter named <code>GenderToColorConverter</code> which is located in the <strong>Converters</strong> folder. This is located in the <em>application</em> resources and reused on both pages. You're going to remove it from the second page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>QuoteDetailPage</code> XAML file and locate the <code>Label</code> which displays the author name.</li>
<li>Change the <code>TextColor</code> property to just be &quot;Blue&quot; and remove the binding. Now all quote authors will be in blue.</li>
<li>Add a <code>DataTrigger</code> to the <code>Label</code> which changes the <code>TextColor</code> property when the <code>Gender</code> is <code>Gender.Female</code>. Refer to the slides if you need some guidance, or check the code hint below.</li>
<li>Run the application and navigate to the Eleanor Roosevelt quote. The quote author at the bottom of the page should be in pink.</li>
<li>You might want to use the same technique on the <code>QuoteListPage</code> as well - however it won't work there. That's using a <code>TextCell</code> to display the quote - and unfortunately, <code>TextCell</code> does not derive from <code>VisualElement</code> where the trigger support lives. So, it will either need to be changed to a <code>ViewCell</code> with a full <code>Label</code> (which is less efficient than <code>TextCell</code>), or continue using a converter. Here, you've chosen the latter as it doesn't hurt anything, however you could try the former if you have some extra time.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="prettyprint-collapse"><code>&lt;Label Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; Text=&quot;{Binding Author}&quot;
                TextColor=&quot;<mark>Blue</mark>&quot;
                HorizontalOptions=&quot;End&quot; HorizontalTextAlignment=&quot;End&quot;&gt;
    <mark>&lt;Label.Triggers&gt;</mark>
    <mark>    &lt;DataTrigger TargetType=&quot;Label&quot;</mark>
    <mark>                Binding=&quot;{Binding Gender}&quot;</mark>
    <mark>                Value=&quot;Female&quot;&gt;</mark>
    <mark>        &lt;Setter Property=&quot;TextColor&quot; Value=&quot;Pink&quot; /&gt;</mark>
    <mark>    &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;</mark>
    <mark>&lt;/Label.Triggers&gt;</mark>
&lt;/Label&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Exercise summary</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you've pushed the selection management into the view model and started removing value converters, instead relying on properties with triggers to control the visual properties.</p>
<p>You can view the completed solution in the <strong>Exercise 1</strong> &gt; <strong>Completed</strong> folder of your copy of the cloned or downloaded <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/XAM320/">course materials</a>.</p>
