        <h2>Introduction to Xamarin.Forms (XAM120)</h2>
<p>Xamarin.Forms lets you define a single UI that you share across all your supported platforms. This maximizes your ability to share code: you can share your UI and your business logic. In this course, you will create a new Xamarin.Forms application and define your shared UI in code. You will also see how to access platform-specific features such as the phone dialer or camera that do not have a shared-programming model integrated into Xamarin.Forms.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Creating your first Xamarin.Forms application</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this exercise is to create a new Xamarin.Forms application using the project templates in Visual Studio on macOS or Windows. We will then walk through the project and explore all the parts. Our secondary goal is to explore how to share code between platform-specific projects. </p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Creating Xamarin.Forms Phoneword</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to create a new Xamarin.Forms application which displays a UI to translate an alphanumeric phone number to a numeric number and place a call. The UI will consist of a: <code>Label</code>, an <code>Entry</code>, and two <code>Button</code> controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Adding support for dialing the phone</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to add platform-specific behavior into our Phoneword application to display an alert and let the user dial the phone. </p>
</li>
</ol>
